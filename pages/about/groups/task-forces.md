Task forces operate under specific working groups to support them with particular tasks for their deliverables.

## [Accessibility Conformance Testing Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/conformance-testing/)

## [ARIA Authoring Practices Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/practices/)

The objective of the ARIA Authoring Practices (APG) Task Force is to develop the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide which describes considerations that might not be evident to most authors from the WAI-ARIA specification alone, and recommends approaches to make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible using WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties.<br />(Supports the [ARIA Working Group](/about/groups/ariawg/))

## [Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/coga/)

## [Low Vision Accessibility Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/low-vision-a11y-tf/) (LVTF) under the [AG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/)

    specific to people with low vision.

## [Maturity Model Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/maturity-model/)

The objective of the Maturity Model (MM) Task Force is to help organizations build capacity to develop and maintain accessible products and services by crafting an Accessibility Maturity Model (AMM) with an assessment tool that incorporates W3C standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and other related guidance, such as Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA).<br />(Supports the [APA Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/))

## [Mobile Accessibility Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/matf/)

## [Research Question Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/research-questions/)

The objective of the Research Questions (RQ) Task Force is to identify accessibility barriers and knowledge gaps in emerging and future web technologies, as well as research opportunities to inform those barriers and fill those gaps, where possible.<br />(Supports the [APA Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/))

## [Silver Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/silver/) under the [AG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/)

:   Perform preliminary development of a new version of Accessibility
    Guidelines following a research-focused, user-centered design
    methodology to produce the most effective and flexible outcome.
    These guidelines will address the process of making content and
    functionality accessible to people with disabilities, including the
    roles of content authoring, user agent support, and authoring tool
    support. These guidelines will address current technological and
    cultural web accessibility requirements and provide a base for
    continued evolution of the guidelines.
    
## [Spoken Presentation Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/pronunciation/)

## [WAI-Adapt Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/adapt/)

The objective of the WAI-Adapt Task Force is to refine the WAI-Adapt specification which supports authors to increase web accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities by adding semantic information that enables users to personalize how content is presented in order to meet their needs and preferences.<br />(Supports the [APA Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/))

## [WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/wcag2x-backlog/)

## [WCAG2ICT Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/wcag2ict/)

The objective of the WCAG2ICT Task Force is to develop documentation describing how WCAG 2.x and its principles, guidelines, and success criteria could apply to non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (ICT).<br />(Supports the [AG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/))
