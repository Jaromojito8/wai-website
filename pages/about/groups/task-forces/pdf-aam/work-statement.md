## Status

The PDF-AAM Task Force Work Statement was [approved on 14 September 2017]() and is now active. The [Task Force home page](/about/groups/task-forces/pdf-aam/) contains information about the operation and resources of the group.

## Objective

The mission of the PDF-AAM Task Force is to specify [Accessibility API mappings for Portable Document Format (PDF)](http://w3c.github.io/pdf-aam/), in consultation with the ARIA Working Group. The task force provides a focused forum for this work while the Working Group continues its work on ARIA development.

## Scope of Work

The PDF-AAM Task Force work defines how user agents map accessibility semantics embedded within PDF documents.

## Approach

The group will incorporte existing work from the PDF/UA Processor LWG into a W3C Technical Report, expected to reach the Recommendation Track according to the W3C Process guidelines.

## Communication

PDF-AAM Task Force communications and discussions are visible to the public. The [task force home page](/about/groups/task-forces/pdf-aam/) details communication mechanisms in use. The task force will:

- Support synchronous (e.g., teleconferences, face-to-face meetings) and asynchronous (e.g., mailing list discussions, issue trackers, wiki, surveys, etc.) methods of communication;
- Use the procedures of the [ARIA Working Group Decision Policy](/about/groups/ariawg/decision-policy/) to make decisions;
- Provide updates and feedback to ARIA Working Group teleconferences, as appropriate. These liaisons are primarily the responsibility of the PDF-AAM Task Force Facilitators;
- Maintain information resulting from its activities (deliverables, participants, face-to-face meetings, teleconferences, etc.) on the [PDF-AAM Task Force home page](/about/groups/task-forces/practices/).

## Participation

Any participant in the ARIA Working Group may participate in the PDF-AAM Task Force. Participants should expect to dedicate 2 to 4 hours per week for PDF-AAM Task Force work, which is considered part of the overall work commitment to the ARIA Working Group:

- Remain current on the PDF-AAM Task Force mailing list and respond to postings in a timely manner;
- Provide feedback to editors of specifications via email or by filing bugs;
- Participate in PDF-AAM Task Force teleconferences, or send regrets to the PDF-AAM Task Force mailing list.

Participants may also join PDF-AAM Task Force sub-groups. Sub-groups take on specific assignments for the PDF-AAM Task Force.

If you are interested in becoming a participant of the PDF-AAM Task Force or have any questions regarding its work, contact the task force facilitators.
