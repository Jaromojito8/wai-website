## Work statement

The Mobile A11y Task Force is currently regrouping and creating a new Work Statement for its new direction.

## Current work

The Mobile A11y Task Force supports the deliverables of the [Accessibility Guidelines (AG) Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/).

For details of the current work, see the [Mobile A11y Task Force wiki](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page).

## Contribute to the work

The Mobile A11y Task Force welcomes input from the global accessibility community on mobile accessibility work.

### Contribute without joining the task force

You can contribute to the work without being a member of the task force in the [Mobile A11y GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/Mobile-A11y-TF-Note/issues):
* If you’re aware of an issue with any of the published mobile accessibility resources, raise a new issue.
* Comment on or propose solutions for open mobile accessibility issues.

### Become a participant in the task force

Joining the Mobile A11y Task Force enables you to participate fully in the development of the work and influence the deliverables. You and your organization will also be listed as contributors, where appropriate.

Being a participant involves commitment to support the work of the task force in the following ways:

* Engage actively in the work using the task force’s communication channels.
* Keep up with weekly tasks and the progress of the work &mdash; for example, via the minutes of past meetings, mailing list discussions, and GitHub issue comments.
* Give your input promptly, when it’s needed.

To become a participant in the Mobile A11y Task Force, you must first be a member of the AG Working Group. See [Instructions for joining the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/instructions/).

Once you are a member of the AG Working Group, email the [W3C Staff Contact for the Mobile A11y Task Force](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/mobile-a11y-tf/participants/#staff) to let them know you’d like to join the task force.

**Note:** As a participant in one of the AG Working Group’s task forces, you can choose to focus your time exclusively on the task force deliverables and you do not have to contribute to the working group’s other activities.
